        "description":"One of the world's most exclusive tours(Everest Express or Mountain Flights). Can the magic of flight ever be carried by words? “Why do you want to climb Everest?” was the question which prompted the now world-famous quip, “because it’s there!”We have for decades tried to comprehend what it is that drives men to push themselves to the limits of their physical and mental endurance. Many have tried but failed to summit Everest, the highest peak in the world. It has been the exclusive realm of a select breed of mountaineers, always inaccessible to other mortals. The Everest Express, one of the world’s most exclusive tours, is a lifetime experience. A flight that takes you deep into the Himalayas, flying into valleys close to the rock face, as close as twenty nautical miles from Everest itself. Now you can see the stunning beauty of nature; raw, undiluted and truly majestic."
